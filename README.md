# BioSegNet: Biomedical Image Segmentation

## Overview
BioSegNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for precise segmentation of biomedical images. 
## Detailed Description
Biomedical image segmentation plays a crucial role in medical research, diagnosis, and treatment planning. Accurate segmentation of cellular structures and tissues from biomedical images enables researchers and healthcare professionals to study diseases, monitor treatment effectiveness, and develop novel therapies.

BioSegNet is built upon state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and leverages the power of Python, TensorFlow, and a custom dataset meticulously curated for biomedical applications. The model is trained using a diverse range of biomedical images, encompassing microscopy images, histopathology slides, and medical scans.

The architecture of BioSegNet is optimized for efficiency and accuracy, with multiple convolutional layers and advanced pooling techniques to capture intricate details within biomedical images. Through extensive experimentation and fine-tuning, BioSegNet achieves superior performance in segmenting various cellular structures, including cell nuclei, membranes, and organelles, as well as identifying pathological features such as tumors, lesions, and abnormalities.

## Dataset
The dataset used to train BioSegNet consists of a diverse collection of biomedical images obtained from publicly available repositories, research institutions, and medical centers. Due to privacy and copyright restrictions, the dataset is not publicly available. However, users are encouraged to use their own biomedical datasets or obtain suitable datasets from authorized sources for training and evaluation purposes.
